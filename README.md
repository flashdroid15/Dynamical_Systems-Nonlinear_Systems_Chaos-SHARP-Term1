# Course Description

| Faculty | Course Title | Description |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ---------- | 
| Asst. Prof. Ang Yee Sin | Modelling of Dynamical Systems | This module will introduce how ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be used to simulate dynamical systems. We will first discuss ODEs in classical mechanics, and subsequently introduce ODE-based simulations of complex systems, such as COVID-19 spread, cancer therapy, and city growth. Simple modelling of climate will also be introduced. |
| Prof. Ricky Ang | Nonlinear Systems and Chaos | Students will learn about important concepts of nonlinear dynamics and Chaos focused on its applications to science and engineering. <br><br> Class 1: Linear Stability Analysis, Different Types of Bifurcations <br> Class 2: Extension from 1-Dimensional (1D) to 2D Systems <br> Class 3: Lorentz Equation, Chaos, Strange Attractors |
